# Search-engine
Key Features:

•Inverted Index: Built an efficient inverted index from transcripts to quickly compute IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) values, enhancing search relevance.
•Advanced Tokenization: Implemented a tokenization process that removes punctuation and normalizes text to improve search accuracy.
•TF-IDF Ranking: Applied TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to rank search results, leading to more relevant search outputs.
•Levenshtein Edit Distance: Incorporated the Levenshtein edit distance algorithm to measure similarity between queries and transcript tokens, allowing for better handling of typos and similar queries.
•Query Handling: Developed support for phrase searches and boolean operations to allow complex search queries.

Technologies Used:
